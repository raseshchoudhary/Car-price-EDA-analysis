Are you an autophile and a data lover. Then this is the best place you can be. In this project I have picked a car price dataset and have tried to explore it through some visualizations using python libraries to better understand the dataset.Before we delve into the insights it better if we first under the data variables. Although the Csv file is already attached to this project, I will brief you about the dataset.


# About the dataset.

This dataset set presents the list of various car models along with their names. Apart from this, details about each car model is been given such as fuel type, number of doors, car body, wheel base, length of the car, engine type and all they jazz. Most of the variables in this dataset are numerical except for a few categorical ones.

# This dataset caters to

![alt text](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.gKvF9QO1bVH_lse5lLSsdwAAAA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1)

Any automobile company who wishes to gauge the car specification of its competitors.
Any car afficionado which wishs to visualize the specifications of different car models.
This many even be used by a budding company which wished to understand the ins and out of the automobile market.

# Some valuable insights.

1.There is a positive correlation berween wheelbase and carlength which means that cars with more length require a broader wheel base.Thus if the aim is to make longer cars that the owner should keep in mind that the wheel base is also made broader and vice versa.

2.As we can see that the histograms of both the engine size and horsepower are almost alike which indicates that one effects the other in a positive manner. This is to make the customer understand that if they wish to have a sturdy car with a high horse power that they need a car with a bigger engine which will eventually cost more.

3.Sadan and hatchback carbody cars are more prefers, well the reason can be the price as we can see that these two car bodies are dead cheap. This indicates that the owner is dealing with price elastic customers.

4.The more the engine size, the costlier the vehicle.we can get to the conclusion that a large engine size leads to more horse power, in short engine size and horse power are also correlated.

5.Most of the customers prefer gas cars instead of diesel ones. This could mean that we are dealing with low end customer who want budget cars and lot luxury ones.

6.Majority of the customers tend to prefer sedan cars, where as convertibal cars are least prefered.

# Suggestions.

I would suggest the user to not just read this file but also take a close look at the main file to see the visualizations and then make their own interpretations and it can very from person to person.

# Conclusion and ending note.

Hope that you have gone through the visualizations and have read this file till this point. In this project we looked at how the price of a car can vary based on not just one but multiple parameters. While manufacturing, the manufacturers must properly study the specifications of a car model to gauge the demand and the overall price of the car. With this I wich that you enjoyed and gathered some insights from a car manuacturer's point of view. Thanks for viewing this work.
